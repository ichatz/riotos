# RIOT-OS Applications

This repository provides a collection of applications based on the [RIOT operating system](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT). The applications showcase specific functionalities of the RIOT operating system and how to build an IoT platform using an [STM32 Nucleo-64 development board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f401re.html).

The applications are used as part of the hands-on activities of the [Internet of Things course](http://ichatz.me/Site/InternetOfThings2021) for the [MSc in Computer Engineering](http://ingegneriainformatica.diag.uniroma1.it/en/corsidistudio.htm), of the [Sapienza University of Rome](http://www.uniroma1.it) (in English)

## STM32 Nucleo-64 F401RE development board

The [STM32 Nucleo-64 F401RE](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f401re.html) is a low-cost development board that utilizes an ARM Cortex-M processor to power various combinations of performance and power consumption. The STM32 Nucleo board supports the ARDUINOÂ® Uno V3 connectivity headers and the ST morpho headers allowing the easy expansion of the functionality with a wide choice of specialized shields.

## How to use the RIOT operating system

The [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT) is an open-source microkernel-based operating system designed for a very low memory and energy footprint suitable for embedded devices that depend on real-time capabilities. RIOT provides out-of-the-box support for a very wide low-power wireless and communication stacks, making it an ideal choice to build Internet of Things (IoT) platforms.

To build and use the applications you need to make sure that you have a local copy of the RIOT main code. For detailed instructions on how to clone and build the RIOT OS follow [the instructions in the RIOT repository](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) and the READMEs within the respective application directory.
