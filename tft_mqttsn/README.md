# How to use a TFT ILI9341 LCD with RIOT

Use a TFT ILI9341 LCD with an [STM32 Nucleo-64 F401RE development board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f401re.html) and the [RIOT operating system](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT).

## For this application we will use
- STM32 Nucleo-64 F401RE
- 2.8" TFT ILI9341 LCD with 240RGBx320 resolution connected via SPI serial
- 9 Female to male jumper wires

## STM32 Nucleo-64 F401RE development board

The [STM32 Nucleo-64 F401RE](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f401re.html) is a low-cost development board that utilizes a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 processor to power various combinations of performance and power consumption. The CPU frequency can go as high as 84 MHz while the power consumption can go as low as 2.4uA at standby without RTC. The STM32 Nucleo board supports the ARDUINOÂ® Uno V3 connectivity headers and the ST morpho headers allowing the easy expansion of the functionality with a wide choice of specialized shields.

## The RIOT operating system

The [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT) is an open-source microkernel-based operating system designed for very low memory and energy footprint suitable for embedded devices that depend on real-time capabilities. RIOT provides out-of-the-box support for a very wide low-power wireless and communication stacks, making it an ideal choice to build Internet of Things (IoT) platforms.
